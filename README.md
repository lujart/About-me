- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Luis A. Castillo  (@lujart), and many thanks for visiting my repository!

With a background on Civil, Structural and Earthquake Engineering, I am currently transitioning 
to the IT Industry aiming to become a software developer.

My main areas of interest are Cloud Computing, AI/ML, Robotics, and Geospatial Data Analysis.

I am currently in an exciting learning curve with my coding skills in Python, implementing
Ubuntu to use Linux as the OS of choice, and GitHub. 

Being quite passionate about teamwork and collaboration, I am looking forward to becoming part of a
group of people, with whom I get to reach my fool potential towards creating and implementing
new ideas that help to shape the world of the future. 

It does not scape from me the big resposibility we all have to leave a positive footprint behind. So, 
let's get to work together to achieve exactly that.
